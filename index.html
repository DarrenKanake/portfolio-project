    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Darren—an ambitious and curious tech enthusiast with a passion for problem-solving and lifelong learning. I thrive on the challenge of turning complex ideas into practical solutions and never shy away from starting fresh when something isn’t working. My curiosity drives me to explore the incredible possibilities of technology and what pioneers like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have achieved. I’m a little nerdy in the best way—currently learning French on Duolingo, playing strategy games like chess, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. Tech, teamwork, and creativity are my fuel.</p>

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section id="philosophy">
      <h2>Tech Philosophy</h2>
      <p>I believe technology should be human-centered, ethical, and relentlessly creative. Whether it's solving real-world problems like automating pest control for farmers, or exploring smart kitchen tools for passionate home cooks, I see tech as a bridge between imagination and impact. Curiosity fuels my learning—I dive into embedded systems, modeling, and programming not just for the challenge, but for the endless possibilities they unlock. I'm driven by the idea that no problem is too complex and no starting point too humble. With every line of code, I aim to build something meaningful.</p>

    <!-- INTERESTS -->
    <section id="interests">
      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>I’m fascinated by software engineering, artificial intelligence, and crafting creative web experiences. I enjoy working on tech projects that solve real problems and love collaborating with others—especially when we crack a tough challenge together.</p>
      <p>Outside of tech, I’m a chess enthusiast (still sharpening my skills), a passionate home cook, and someone who dreams of combining tech and culinary arts one day. Maybe I’ll be a tech guru with culinary arts skills! Imagine a kitchen powered by smart recipes, interactive cooking dashboards, and IoT-driven gadgets—where tech meets taste. I’m passionate about creating meaningful experiences, and one day I’d love to merge software and culinary creativity to build tools that empower home chefs around the world.</p>
      <p><strong>Strategic Thinker</strong> – Fueled by chessboard tactics & logic-based exploration. I approach problem-solving with strategy, precision, and a love for the game. Whether it's coding or chess, I enjoy the thrill of discovery and mastery.</p>
